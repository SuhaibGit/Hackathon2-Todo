## Prompt

Project: hackathon-todo (Phase II – Full-Stack Todo App)

Current focus: Complete the frontend layer first (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Better Auth)

Goal of this plan:
Produce a realistic, sequential, agent-assignable plan to build a fully functional, responsive frontend MVP — even while the backend API is incomplete or stubbed.
Use mocks / localStorage / in-memory data for task persistence during frontend development.
The frontend should be "pluggable" — minimal changes needed when switching from mocks to real FastAPI endpoints.

Key constraints / assumptions:
- Backend API not yet fully implemented → use mock responses in lib/api.ts
- Better Auth handles signup/signin + JWT issuance on frontend
- Simulate user-specific tasks with localStorage keyed by user ID/email
- No real database calls yet — defer Neon + SQLModel integration to next phase
- All API calls go through centralized lib/api.ts (with token handling)
- Protected routes: redirect to signin when not authenticated
- Mobile-first responsive UI with Tailwind

Read these specs first (reference them explicitly):
@specs/features/task-crud.md
@specs/features/authentication.md
@specs/ui/pages.md
@specs/ui/components.md
@specs/api/rest-endpoints.md (for endpoint shapes to mock)

Major milestones for frontend completion:
1. Project setup & auth foundation (Better Auth + session/JWT handling)
2. Authentication UI (signin, signup, logout, protected layout)
3. Main dashboard / task list page
4. Task CRUD UI (create form, edit modal/form, toggle button, delete button)
5. API client with mock implementations
6. Loading states, error handling, optimistic updates (nice-to-have)
7. Basic accessibility & responsiveness checks
8. Definition of Done + handover to backend integration phase

Plan requirements:
- Break into 8–12 small, independent-ish tasks (each 30–120 minutes of agent work)
- Each task must specify:
  - Task title / goal
  - Files to create or edit
  - High-level what to implement
  - Primary agent responsible (FrontendEngineer, AuthSpecialist, or SpecMaster if clarification needed)
  - Dependencies (previous tasks that must be done first)
  - Acceptance criteria (measurable, testable)
- Include mock strategy details
- End with a "Definition of Done" checklist for frontend readiness
- Suggest the next logical command after this plan finishes (e.g. /sp.specify backend-connection or start assigning tasks)

## Definition of Done (Frontend MVP)
- [ ] All pages/routes exist and render
- [ ] Auth flow works (signup → login → dashboard → logout)
- [ ] Task CRUD works with mocks (create/list/edit/delete/toggle)
- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile/desktop
- [ ] lib/api.ts abstracts all calls (easy to swap mocks → real)
- [ ] Protected routes redirect correctly
- [ ] No console errors / basic accessibility

## Next Phase Recommendation
After this plan is executed → run IntegrationTester on frontend mocks, then proceed to backend implementation or full connection.

Be realistic — prioritize core flows over polish.

## Response snapshot

# Frontend-First Completion Plan – hackathon-todo

**Branch**: `1-todo-frontend` | **Date**: 2026-02-04 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/todo-frontend/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a responsive, functional Next.js frontend that supports all Phase II user stories using mock data/localStorage while the backend API is incomplete. The frontend will be designed to be "pluggable" with minimal changes needed when switching from mocks to real FastAPI endpoints. Uses Better Auth for authentication and follows mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Next.js 16+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js App Router, Better Auth, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: localStorage for task persistence (mock), JWT tokens for auth
**Testing**: Integration testing planned for later
**Target Platform**: Web application (mobile/desktop browsers)
**Project Type**: Web application with frontend and authentication
**Performance Goals**: <1 second perceived response time, mobile-responsive
**Constraints**: All API calls through centralized lib/api.ts, protected routes, mobile-first design
**Scale/Scope**: Single user interface per session, task management features

## Constitution Check

- [x] Specification Primacy: Following the spec at specs/todo-frontend/spec.md
- [x] Strict User Isolation & Security: JWT token handling for auth state
- [x] Layer Separation & Scope: FrontendEngineer will handle only /frontend/ files
- [x] Testability & Evals-First: Planning for testable acceptance criteria
- [x] Minimalism & MVP Focus: Focusing on core CRUD and auth functionality
- [x] Code Quality & Maintainability: Using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Workflow & Agent Coordination: Using FrontendEngineer and AuthSpecialist as needed

**Structure Decision**: Chose web application structure with separate frontend directory for Next.js application, following Next.js App Router conventions.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|

## Current Status & Assumptions

- Backend API not yet fully implemented → using mock responses in lib/api.ts
- Better Auth handles signup/signin + JWT issuance on frontend
- Simulating user-specific tasks with localStorage keyed by user ID/email
- No real database calls yet — deferring Neon + SQLModel integration to next phase
- All API calls will go through centralized lib/api.ts (with token handling)
- Protected routes will redirect to signin when not authenticated
- Mobile-first responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

## Key Decisions / Trade-offs

1. **Mock-First Strategy**: Building with localStorage mocks first to enable parallel frontend/backend development
2. **Centralized API Client**: All backend communication through lib/api.ts to enable easy switching from mocks to real API
3. **Protected Routes**: Implementing client-side route guards for authentication checks
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS utility classes
5. **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript for strong typing across the application

## Mock API Strategy

- Create lib/api.ts with mock implementations that simulate API responses
- Use 300-800ms artificial delays to simulate network latency
- Store tasks in localStorage keyed by user ID to simulate multi-user data isolation
- Simulate JWT token in memory/session for authentication state
- Mock all required endpoints based on @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md shapes:
  - GET /api/users/{user_id}/tasks → return user's tasks from localStorage
  - POST /api/users/{user_id}/tasks → create task in localStorage
  - PUT /api/users/{user_id}/tasks/{task_id} → update task in localStorage
  - DELETE /api/users/{user_id}/tasks/{task_id} → remove task from localStorage
  - GET /api/users/{user_id}/tasks/{task_id} → get specific task from localStorage
