# Spec Validation Skill

## Purpose
Validate specification documents for completeness, consistency, and adherence to project standards before implementation begins.

## Function
- Verify that all required sections are present in the specification
- Check that acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- Ensure security and privacy requirements are addressed
- Validate that dependencies are clearly identified
- Confirm that non-functional requirements are specified
- Check for internal consistency between different parts of the spec

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and falsifiable
- [ ] Security requirements addressed (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- [ ] Performance requirements specified (latency, throughput, resource usage)
- [ ] Error handling requirements defined
- [ ] Edge cases and failure scenarios covered
- [ ] Dependencies on external systems identified
- [ ] Data schema/model requirements specified
- [ ] API contract definitions complete
- [ ] User roles and permissions defined
- [ ] Privacy and compliance requirements addressed
- [ ] Monitoring and observability requirements included

## Output Format
- Return a validation report listing any missing or incomplete sections
- Highlight potential issues or ambiguities
- Suggest improvements for clarity and completeness
- Indicate whether the spec is ready for implementation planning
- Provide specific recommendations for addressing identified gaps
