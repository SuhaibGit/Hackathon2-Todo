# Spec Refinement Proposer Skill

## Purpose
Analyze incomplete or ambiguous specifications and propose specific refinements to improve clarity, completeness, and implementability.

## Function
- Identify ambiguous or underspecified requirements
- Propose concrete implementations for abstract requirements
- Suggest additional test cases and edge cases
- Recommend architectural approaches based on project constraints
- Propose solutions for identified technical challenges
- Suggest breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable pieces

## Analysis Process
1. **Identify Ambiguities**: Find vague terms, undefined behaviors, or missing details
2. **Context Analysis**: Consider project constraints, technology stack, and existing architecture
3. **Proposal Generation**: Create specific, implementable alternatives
4. **Trade-off Analysis**: Evaluate proposed solutions against project goals
5. **Recommendation**: Present the best approach with reasoning

## Proposal Structure
- **Issue Identified**: Describe the ambiguity or incompleteness
- **Impact Assessment**: Explain how this affects implementation
- **Proposed Solution**: Provide a specific, implementable solution
- **Alternative Options**: List other possible approaches with pros/cons
- **Recommendation**: Suggest the preferred approach with justification
- **Implementation Notes**: Provide guidance for implementation

## Output Format
- Clear identification of specification gaps or ambiguities
- Specific, actionable proposals for each identified issue
- Prioritized recommendations based on importance and feasibility
- Technical considerations and potential challenges
- Alignment with project constraints and architecture
